= Releasing Kafka-CDI to maven central

With the correct setup user account on `oss.sonatype` servers, and a correctly configured `gpg`, we use the Maven release plugin to run the release.

It's a two step process of `mvn release:prepare`, followed by `mvn release:perform`, while both need some extra arguments, like:

[source,bash]
----
mvn release:prepare -Dgpg.useagent=true -Darguments=-Dgpg.passphrase=XYZ_SUPER -Pjboss-release,gpg-sign
mvn release:perform -Dgpg.useagent=true -Darguments=-Dgpg.passphrase=XYZ_SUPER -Pjboss-release,gpg-sign
